The projects for this class assume you use Python 2.7.

Project 0 will cover the following:

<ul>
<li>Project grading: Every project’s release includes its autograder for you to run yourself.</li>
<li>Python basics</li>
</ul>
<strong>Files to Edit and Submit:</strong> You will fill in portions of addition.py, buyLotsOfFruit.py, and shopSmart.py in tutorial.zip during the assignment. You should submit these files with your code and comments. Please <em>do not</em> change the other files in this distribution or submit any of our original files other than these files. Submit the files via Blackboard as a zip-file with your ASU ID as name, e.g. 1234567890.zip . <strong>This project has to be submitted individually (no group work allowed!).</strong>

<strong>Evaluation:</strong> Your code will be autograded for technical correctness. Please <em>do not</em> change the names of any provided functions or classes within the code, or you will wreak havoc on the autograder. However, the correctness of your implementation — not the autograder’s judgements — will be the final judge of your score. If necessary, we will review and grade assignments individually to ensure that you receive due credit for your work.

<strong>Academic Dishonesty:</strong> We will be checking your code against other submissions in the class for logical redundancy. If you copy someone else’s code and submit it with minor changes, we will know. These cheat detectors are quite hard to fool, so please don’t try. We trust you all to submit your own work only; <em>please</em> don’t let us down. If you do, we will pursue the strongest consequences available to us.

<strong>Getting Help:</strong> You are not alone! If you find yourself stuck on something, contact the course staff for help. Office hours, classes, and the discussion forum are there for your support; please use them.&nbsp; We want these projects to be rewarding and instructional, not frustrating and demoralizing. But, we don’t know when or how to help unless you ask.

<strong>Discussion:</strong> Please be careful not to post spoilers.

<strong>Questions: </strong>We will post for each project a document like this containing all questions you have to work on. Although our course is based upon the CS188 AI class at Berkeley, <strong>we might change, add or remove tasks</strong>! Thus, make always sure to read this document.

<strong>More Information: </strong>You can find a very good Python introduction on the website of the CS188 course http://ai.berkeley.edu/tutorial.html

<h1>Autograding</h1>
To get you familiarized with the autograder, we will ask you to code, test, and submit solutions for three questions.

You can download all of the files associated the autograder tutorial as a zip archive on Blackboard: tutorial.zip. Unzip this file and examine its contents:

[cs188-ta@nova ~]$ unzip tutorial.zip

[cs188-ta@nova ~]$ cd tutorial [cs188-ta@nova ~/tutorial]$ ls addition.py autograder.py buyLotsOfFruit.py grading.py projectParams.py shop.py shopSmart.py testClasses.py testParser.py test_cases tutorialTestClasses.py

This contains a number of files you’ll edit or run:

<ul>
<li>py: source file for question 1</li>
<li>py: source file for question 2</li>
<li>py: source file for question 3</li>
<li>py: source file for question 3</li>
<li>py: autograding script (see below) and others you can ignore:</li>
<li>test_cases: directory contains the test cases for each question</li>
<li>py: autograder code</li>
<li>py: autograder code</li>
<li>py: test classes for this particular project</li>
<li>py: project parameters</li>
</ul>
The command python autograder.py grades your solution to all three problems. If we run it before editing any files we get a page or two of output:

[cs188-ta@nova ~/tutorial]$ python autograder.py

Question q3: 0/1

Total: 0/3

Your grades are NOT yet registered.&nbsp; To register your grades, make sure to follow your instructor’s guidelines to receive credit on your project.

For each of the three questions, this shows the results of that question’s tests, the questions grade, and a final summary at the end. Because you haven’t yet solved the questions, all the tests fail. As you solve each question you may find some tests pass while other fail. When all tests pass for a question, you get full marks.

Looking at the results for question 1, you can see that it has failed three tests with the error message “add(a,b) must return the sum of a and b”. The answer your code gives is always 0, but the correct answer is different. We’ll fix that in the next task.

<h1>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Question: Addition</h1>
Open addition.py and look at the definition of add:

def add(a, b):

“Return the sum of a and b”

“*** YOUR CODE HERE ***”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return 0

The tests called this with a and b set to different values, but the code always returned zero. Modify this definition to read:

def add(a, b):

“Return the sum of a and b”

print “Passed a=%s and b=%s, returning a+b=%s” % (a,b,a+b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return a+b

Now rerun the autograder (omitting the results for questions 2 and 3):

[cs188-ta@nova ~/tutorial]$ python autograder.py -q q1

Starting on 1-21 at 23:52:05

Question q1

===========

Passed a=1 and b=1, returning a+b=2

*** PASS: test_cases/q1/addition1.test

***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add(a,b) returns the sum of a and b

Passed a=2 and b=3, returning a+b=5

*** PASS: test_cases/q1/addition2.test

***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add(a,b) returns the sum of a and b

Passed a=10 and b=-2.1, returning a+b=7.9

*** PASS: test_cases/q1/addition3.test

***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add(a,b) returns the sum of a and b

You now pass all tests, getting full marks for question 1. Notice the new lines “Passed a=…” which appear before “*** PASS: …”. These are produced by the print statement in add. You can use print statements like that to output information useful for debugging. You can also run the autograder with the option –mute to temporarily hide such lines, as follows:

[cs188-ta@nova ~/tutorial]$ python autograder.py -q q1 –mute

Starting on 1-22 at 14:15:33

***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add(a,b) returns the sum of a and b

*** PASS: test_cases/q1/addition2.test

***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add(a,b) returns the sum of a and b

*** PASS: test_cases/q1/addition3.test

***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add(a,b) returns the sum of a and b

### Question q1: 1/1 ###

<h1>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Question: buyLotsOfFruit function</h1>
Add a buyLotsOfFruit(orderList) function to buyLotsOfFruit.py which takes a list of (fruit,pound) tuples and returns the cost of your list. If there is some fruit in the list which doesn’t appear in fruitPrices it should print an error message and return None. Please do not change the fruitPrices variable.

Run python autograder.py until question 2 passes all tests and you get full marks. Each test will confirm that buyLotsOfFruit(orderList) returns the correct answer given various possible inputs. For example, test_cases/q2/food_price1.test tests whether:

Cost of [(‘apples’, 2.0), (‘pears’, 3.0), (‘limes’, 4.0)] is 12.25

<h1>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Question: shopSmart function</h1>
Fill in the function shopSmart(orders,shops) in shopSmart.py, which takes an orderList (like the kind passed in to FruitShop.getPriceOfOrder) and a list of FruitShop and returns the FruitShop where your order costs the least amount in total. Don’t change the file name or variable names, please. Note that we will provide the shop.py implementation as a “support” file, so you don’t need to submit yours.

Run python autograder.py until question 3 passes all tests and you get full marks. Each test will confirm that shopSmart(orders,shops) returns the correct answer given various possible inputs. For example, with the following variable definitions:

orders1 = [(‘apples’,1.0), (‘oranges’,3.0)] orders2 = [(‘apples’,3.0)]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir1 = {‘apples’: 2.0, ‘oranges’:1.0} shop1 =&nbsp; shop.FruitShop(‘shop1’,dir1) dir2 = {‘apples’: 1.0, ‘oranges’: 5.0} shop2 = shop.FruitShop(‘shop2’,dir2) shops = [shop1, shop2] test_cases/q3/select_shop1.test tests whether:

shopSmart.shopSmart(orders1, shops) == shop1 and test_cases/q3/select_shop2.test tests whether: shopSmart.shopSmart(orders2, shops) == shop2
